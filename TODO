Huge list of stuff to do:

Mesh repair:
  Check manifoldness
  Fix orientation

Custom tolerances?

Subdivision surfaces:
  Loop
  sqrt(3)

Surface simplification

Differential stuff:
  Tangent space calculations
  Exponential maps
  Parallel transport

Metrics:
  Minkowski functionals

Geometry queries:  
  Closest feature
  Distance to point
  Point membership test

Finite element:
  Stiffness matrix assembly
  Laplacian eigen functions

Solid modeling:
  Booleans
  Minkowski sums
  
Interoperability:
  parsers/exporters for different STL, VRML, etc.

...and probably much more
